Dust off the old PC you found in the attic, boot AnthrOS, and plug in the dial-up modem.

Your online friends — unlike the IRL ones you left back in the city — are ready and waiting for you.

It's time to log back into FCHAT.

Anthrotari is a visual novel written in [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) and created during the [International Love Ultimatum 2016 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/ilujam2).
